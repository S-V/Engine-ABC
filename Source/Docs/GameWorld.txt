* design idea:
	Engine has a unique world,
	world has several environments,
	each environment contains one render world, one sound world, one physics world;
	environments cannot overlap, but they can be viewed through portals.


Units:

  Physics units == Graphics units,
  
  my units are in meters,
  
  1 meter = 1 unit,

  1 m = 1.0f
  1 kg = 1.0f
