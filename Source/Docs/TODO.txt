* post-processing effects: NPR (painting, scetch, etc.)
* post-processing effect: glow.
* sample apps: hierarchical culling (octree, KD-tree, AABB, ABT, etc.), many identical objects, use occlusion queries
  demo CustomShaders: asphalt with a separate specular map.

* bump mapping, horizon mapping, POM with self-shadowing
  shadow-casting point and directional lights

* Move material to a per-batch, not per-mesh attribute.

* reduce code duplication in shaders (esp. in the code for post-processing)

* select screen settings at start time from config files (i.e. screen res should not be hardcoded),
 add collision detection (esp. to CSG demo)

* lazy-evaluate everything in the renderer (e.g. don't init sky & post-processing system until they are really needed, etc.)

* proper dynamic geometry management in D3D10 renderer

* DONE: post-processing demo: Bloom & DoF, keys +/-

* parallax mapping

* polygon clipping as 'wrapping', like in RF1

* DONE: EPlaneSide: PLANESIDE_FRONT = 0, etc.

* DONE: rename AABB::mPoints to mPoints

* DONE: MeshLoader should measure loading times, bytes of RAM used by geometry, etc.

* DONE: make a StaticAssert()

* DONE: make a method Matrix4::RotateVector() (the same as TransformNormal())

* design a nice interface to csg system

- remove "virtual Unbind()" because it's analogous to Apply()

* some shadow maps (from the Sun, e.g.) don't need to be updated each frame

* optimize local lights, don't reset depth/stencil, rasterizer and other states in each RenderLocalLight(),
because it hurts early-Z, sort lights, use SpatialDatabase::GetEntitiesInPoint() to get lights enclosing the camera,
use hashmap (MAX_NUM_LIGHTS = 512, for example) to get visible lights, not containing the eye, etc...
use instancing for drawing many small non-shadowing lights;
try deferred shadowing (render all shadows into screen-sized buffer to apply them later, as a post-process,
 in order to minimize depth-stencil state switches), blur the shadow buffer (screen-space blurred soft shadows).

* DONE: add CameraNode, debug spot lights (attach spotlight to the camera, ... )

* Animator_LookAt::Animate

* DONE: make a special class NodePtr - a reference-counting pointer.

* DONE:in FillGBuffer.fx:

  row_major float4x4   WorldViewProjection;
  
  is not needed, instead, use this:

  output.positionW 	= mul( float4( input.position, 1 ), WorldTransform );  
  output.positionH	= mul( float4( output.positionW, 1 ), ViewProjection );

  i.e. only these matrices are really needed:
  
  WorldTransform
  ViewProjection
 
* texture coordinate transformation

* OPTIMIZATION: separate geometry into vertex stream, use a Z pre-pass using only position components.

  change FCOlor to colorRGBA ?

* DONE: skyboxes
* cubemap skyboxes

* all resources (well, almost all) should be reference-counted (look at DXSDK).

* DONE: all effects should contain only one technique with only one pass.

* DONE: replace mxSystem::IsRunning() with bool bIsRunning because pure virtual function call happens just at the program exit.

 }

* TODO: use the stack allocator for temporary allocations (mesh creation, 'scratchpad', etc.)

* DONE: remove csg code from Core.h


* mxMeshBuilder should be a templated class (allocator - template parameter, stack allocator for small allocations),
should be declared locally, it should not be global.

* make sure that TArray checks for negative indices (e.g. index < 0 ) are optimized out in release builds
(because TArray works with positive indices)

//
//template< class T, class S >
//T * CastChecked( S* src );


* use static polymorphism to avoid calling virtual functions:

    inserts the entity into the entity database only;
    then, after, scene->Build(), all other subsystems are constructed
    (deferred initialization, deferred loading of resources - more opportunities for optimizations):
    spatial database, render world, etc.

  maybe, there'll be a function mxScene::SetBuiltOptions(...)
  so that you can specify what optimizations to perform, spatial acceleration structures to employ, etc.



* TODO: improve stability of the engine (it chokes on invalid or missing data).

* on the game engine:
  break the source code further into namespaces 'system', 'io', 'video', 'sound', etc. ?


* on the render command buffer:

  instructions can be re-ordered, but data cannot be changed.


* on the future compiler ( IDE ):
  a special preprocessor directive, SKIP or something, for skipping the following contents of the current source file.

* macros like MX_TODO, MX_HACK and so on should include timestamp.

* on optimizing collision detection system:
  Try to merge as many static collision objects together as possible
  so that they don't pollute the broad phase.

* in benchmark/profile/test/debug mode, record collisions when using hash tables
 to check efficiency of the selected hash functions.

	Template integer parameters

If an integer value is a constant in the application code, but is a variable in library code, make it a template parameter.

Let's assume you are writing the following library function, in which both x and y do not have a known value when the library is developed:
int f1(int x, int y) { return x * y; }

Such function may be called from the following application code, in which x does not have a constant value, but y is the constant 4:
int a = f1(b, 4);

If, when you write the library, you know that the caller will surely pass a constant for the argument y, you can transform your function into the following function template:
template <int Y> int f2(int x) { return x * Y; }

Such function may be called from the following application code:
int a = f2<4>(b);

Such a call instantiates automatically the following function:
int f2(int x) { return x * 4; }

The latter function is faster than the former function f1, for the following reasons:
Only one argument is passed to the function (x) instead of two (x and y).
The multiplication by an integer constant (4) is always faster than a multiplication by an integer variable (y).
As the constant value (4) is a power of two, the compiler, instead of performing an integer multiplication, performs a bit shift.

In general, the integer template parameters are constants for those who instantiate the template and therefore for the compiler, and constants are handled more efficiently than variables. In addition, some operations involving constants are pre-computed at compilation-time.

If, instead of a normal function, you already have a function template, it is enough to add a further parameter to that template.

 !!!!!!!!! make this with epsilons !!!!!

* Kernel manages tasks:

two lists: active tasks and suspended (paused);

task scheduling;

AddTask
RemoveTask
Resume/Suspend task
TerminateAllTasks

sort tasks by priority
( transforms need to be recalculated before updating bounding volumes, etc. )

Example:

scene manager can switch ScenePresenters
 between ActiveScenePresenter ( renders the scene every frame )
 and OnIdleScenePresenter ( doesn't render the scene, has a list of taks to be performed
  ( optimize the scene more during idle time, etc. ) )


* statistics gathering, histograms:
  
  Threading model
  Memory usage
  CPU
  GPU
  
  Event
  Update
  Cull
  Draw


* User interactions with the scene graph:
  Manipulators (controllers), sensors (triggers), event handling.

* DONE: cause a console window to pop up in debug builds.

* TODO: use a separate memory pool for allocating scene graph nodes ( to avoid cache misses, minimize memory fragmentation, etc ).

* The render world should not know anything about the scene graph.
It should render visible sets cached in views.
Visible sets don't need to be recomputed if their corresponding views haven't changed.

* use scene graph validation, detect cyclic references.

* TODO: add CHAR to typedefs.h; CHAR will depend on _UNICODE.

Cull, Sort, Draw

* TODO: 
  in Debug.h, use platform-specific functions for errors, etc.,
  extern void AppError( const char* format, ... ).

* static Unimplemented feature, calling an unimplemented function will generate a compile-time error.

* proceduraly generated clouds, trees & shrubs, terrains & caves & rocks, fluid meshes, buildings, explosions, fire, etc.

* on a future compiler ( IDE ):
   near bookmarks you can see the function/class/etc where this bookmark has been placed ( not only the file and linenumber ),
   that would be more convenient.

* Entity manager,
  Create entity by name( const char* name ).

* mxGraphicsResourceManager for creating textures, meshes, hardware buffers, etc.
D3D9ResourceManager ...

graphics API description with costs for each function ( with context info, too ).

* create a framework for generating demos, invent a custom scripting engine ( C4 ),
write scenes in that language, produce source code (C++) and shaders (or .fx files)
and compile the resulting demo.
We can generate entire games with such a powerful tool!
We should use procedural content generation!

* The text FALLBACK MATERIAL should be rendered sharply ( remember the article about road signs in Game Gems ).

* allocate render entities from render world;
  make their ctor/dtor protected, etc.

* on his [ nullsquared's ] videos only rectangular portals are shown;
we can make a spherical portal ( imagine a spherical mirror ).

* Scene graph compiler ( scene -> into C++ code );
  perform extensive analysis of the scene;
  generate shaders unique to that scene;
  don't generate code ( modules: renderer, physics, etc. ) that is not used;
  may compile textures into C++ files so that no media files are needed;
  ...
  result - C++ file - source code for the demo,
  the demo will be optimized as much as possible depending on the hardware,
  application parameters, scene, etc.



* Fallback material should be generated procedurally, including the text "Fallback material",
  OR
  they are compiled into a C/C++ file and linked into the executable.

* Caches:
From Wiki:
	"Hash tables can be used to implement caches, auxiliary data tables that are used to speed up the access to data that is primarily stored in slower media. In this application, hash collisions can be handled by discarding one of the two colliding entries — usually the one that is currently stored in the table."

* Self-balancing ( binary ) search trees:
Similarly, many algorithms in computational geometry exploit variations on self-balancing BSTs to solve problems such as the line segment intersection problem and the point location problem efficiently.

* input event queues ( esp. for keyboard, order of pressed keys is important ... )

* memory optimizer, memory tracking, remapping and defragmentation

* stereo rendering ( both methods:
two views for each eye and two pics ( red & cyan, for use with glasses ).

TODO: get rid of unneeded types!
