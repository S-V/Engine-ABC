# Engine-ABC
My first graphics engine, developed for B.S. (2010): naive deferred shading, D3D10 effects. Contains some stolen code (idLib from Prey SDK). Uses a null Irrlicht.dll to load meshes. Contains a lousy impl of real-time CSG via BSP tree merging. Overall, as a beginner engine it's crappy, but relatively well-commented.
